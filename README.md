## Preview locally

## What I added to prepare the repo

- README.md — this file (overview + instructions)
- LICENSE — MIT license
- .gitignore — ignore common OS/tooling files

## Next recommended steps

- Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (Source: main branch / root) to publish the site.
- Optimize the two large images (SMC.png, My pic.JPG) to reduce repo size and page load time.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md and ISSUE templates if you plan to accept contributions.
- Optionally add a GitHub Actions workflow to build & deploy to gh-pages automatically.

## Notes

This repository currently contains static HTML and CSS only. If you want me to add an automated Pages workflow, optimize images, or create a gh-pages branch, tell me and I will make those changes.
