  <main>
    <p>Welcome to your school website portal. Access your services, resources, and support here.
    In a progressive step towards global academic collaboration, <b>SMC University</b> has partnered with <b>KNUST (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology)</b> to bring a unified digital experience to students across borders. This partnership allows SMC University to extend its student portal access through the KNUST platform, making it easier for Ghana-based students to stay connected with their academic journey.

Whether you are a student enrolled at SMC University or a local learner seeking international-quality education, this platform has been designed to offer you a smooth, connected, and comprehensive learning experience. Students of SMC residing in Ghana or elsewhere can now log in through the KNUST-linked portal to access key services such as:

- Course materials & e-learning
- Academic records
- Internship opportunities
- Result statements
- Exam timetables
- Service updates & more
This collaboration is more than just technical integration — it represents a commitment to accessible, cross-institutional learning. KNUST and SMC together aim to empower students with the tools, support, and flexibility needed to thrive in today’s global academic environment.

As education continues to evolve, this partnership ensures that no student is left behind, regardless of their location.</p>
